Our project focuses on identifying common vulnerabilities in DeFi smart contracts and analyzing their legal and criminal implications. With the rapid rise of decentralized finance, smart contracts have become the backbone of many financial systems.
However, they also introduce critical security risks, including reentrancy, oracle manipulation, flash loan attacks, and poor access control. We studied major DeFi hacks like the DAO, bZx Protocol, and PancakeBunny to understand how these exploits were executed and what weaknesses they targeted. In addition, we developed a Python-based legality checker tool that verifies hash validity and analyzes smart contract features for legal risks based on user inputs such as contract type, jurisdiction, and centralized control.
This tool highlights potential issues like gambling laws, Ponzi schemes, and KYC mismatches. While the checker is basic and rule-based, it helps raise awareness about the importance of secure coding and legal compliance in DeFi. The report concludes that securing DeFi systems requires a combination of strong technical safeguards, smart economic design, and evolving legal frameworks. As DeFi continues to grow, both developers and users must stay informed and proactive to build a safer decentralized future.
